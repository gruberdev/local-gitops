      Creating a k3d cluster

      This command ensures the cluster on k3d will
      be created with all the correct parameters, allowing
      for a declarative setup that requires minimal intervention
      to work. k3d is configured to automatically create an entry
      on your KUBECONFIG file and update it to point towards the cluster.

      All commands that create resources also are specific to the cluster
      name configured on the file ('k3d-demo'), as to avoid creating those
      resoures on non-local clusters that may be on KUBECONFIG file as well.
    cmds:
    - task: cli:clear
    - k3d cluster delete demo
    - docker volume delete storage
    - docker volume create storage
    - k3d cluster create --config config/cluster/linux.yaml
    - task: cli:highlight_normal
    - echo -e "\nYour cluster has been created. Type 'k3d cluster list' to confirm."
